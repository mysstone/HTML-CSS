Open the print.css file in your text editor and add the following styles to the style sheet:
Prevent the display of the nav container element.
Set the left margin of the content container element to be 0 pixels
Remove the background for the body element and set its margin and padding to 0 (on all sides).
Remove the border for the layout container div.
Save your changes to the print.css file
View the about.html pages by double clicking on it (if you already have the about.html page open,
you will need to refresh for you to be able to see the changes you have made to the print.css file).
Choose print preview for "About Us page.  The menu and background image should disappear and the page
should look something like the image below.  It is possible that the background images and colors that
you set will not display.  That depends on the settings the user has defined for their browser
(you can print or not print background colors and images):
